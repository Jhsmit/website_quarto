My interest in mechanisms of physical law and biological machinery is what drives me to do research. I have a strong background in both Chemistry and Physics as well as programming expertise which allows me to contribute to a broad range of interdisciplinary research projects. In our lab we use a combination of HDX-MS ans smFRET to study protein (non)folding and chaperone interactions.
